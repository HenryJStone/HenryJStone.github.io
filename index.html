                    Hello! My name is Henry Stone and I created this webpage 
                    to be a center where I can display projects and interests I have.
                    It will also provide information about myself as well as my contact information!

                <h2 style="text-align: center">About Me</h2>
                <p style="padding-left: 18px">
                    I am currently a sophomore pursuing a computer science major
                    and an applied mathematics minor at Gonzaga University.
                    Some topics I'm currently interested in include machine learing, data science,
                    AI, as well as overall learning more about software development and looking into game
                    development. At Gonzaga I am a part of Gonzaga's Concert Choir and also a member of
                    the GU ACM club. In my free time I enjoy playing piano, guitar, and bass guitar. 
                    I'm a rather big fan of the Oklahoma City Thunder, and enjoy 
                    fencing as well as playing basketball.
